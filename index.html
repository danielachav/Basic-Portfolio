                 <p>Welcome to my page! 
                     My name is Daniela Chavez. I was born and raised in Lima, Peru so I am fluent in both Spanish and English, as well as dabble in a bit of French. 
                    I am now living in Dallas, Texas. I love to travel and recently visited 7 countries in Europe and hope to explore more! </p>
                 <p>Once I graduated High School, I started school at Loyola University New Orleans where I obtained my degree in Mass Communications; Journalism Sequence with a minor in English. 
                    During my time at the university, I was able to further my education by taking a range of classes varying from “Politics & The Media” to “Creative Writing”.</p>
                <p>Because of the sequence I chose, I was able to take classes in Digital Communications, Videography, Photography, Law of Mass Communications, Public Relations, Advertising and Social Media Strategies.</p> 
                 <p>After graduating, I began freelancing in web design which then took my interest into the technological aspect of creating websites which is why I enrolled at SMU’s Full-Stack Flex Bootcamp to expand my skill set and knowledge in programming and coding. 
                    Because of this I’ve been able to build up a portfolio of more professional work. </p>
                <p>If you’d like to work with me, send me an email!</p>
